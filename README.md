[TmpUsb](https://www.medo64.com/tmpusb/)
========================================

TmpUsb is presented to a computer as an USB disk drive 11 KB in size (7-8 KB
usable). This drive can be then used to store any data (providing that size is
not the issue) but primary idea is to use it for the encryption keys. Once all
data has been copied to it, user would perform "arming" thus enabling self-erase
after approximately 3 seconds of being unplugged.

This package provides an utility to help with mounting and unmounting this
drive.
